Known bugs and oddities in misago:

script/generate:
 * resource : model test must extend Unit_TestCase and not Unit_Test.

ActiveRecord::Base:
 * tests for updating many record are broken?
 * calling an unknown method of ActiveRecord_Base must trigger a 'no such method' error.
 * misses before_delete and after_delete protected methods.
