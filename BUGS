Known bugs and oddities in misago:

ActiveRecord::Base:
 * calling an unknown method of ActiveRecord_Base must trigger a 'no such method' error.
 * delete should instanciate the object before deletion.
 * before_delete and after_delete aren't used.

script/generate resource
 * must create AccountsController and not AccountController. Plural, not singular!
